SQL Schema
Pandas Schema
Table: Project

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| project_id  | int     |
| employee_id | int     |
+-------------+---------+
(project_id, employee_id) is the primary key of this table.
employee_id is a foreign key to Employee table.
Each row of this table indicates that the employee with employee_id is working on the project with project_id.
 

Table: Employee

+------------------+---------+
| Column Name      | Type    |
+------------------+---------+
| employee_id      | int     |
| name             | varchar |
| experience_years | int     |
+------------------+---------+
employee_id is the primary key of this table. It's guaranteed that experience_years is not NULL.
Each row of this table contains information about one employee.
 

Write an SQL query that reports the average experience years of all the employees for each project, rounded to 2 digits.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Project table:
+-------------+-------------+
| project_id  | employee_id |
+-------------+-------------+
| 1           | 1           |
| 1           | 2           |
| 1           | 3           |
| 2           | 1           |
| 2           | 4           |
+-------------+-------------+
Employee table:
+-------------+--------+------------------+
| employee_id | name   | experience_years |
+-------------+--------+------------------+
| 1           | Khaled | 3                |
| 2           | Ali    | 2                |
| 3           | John   | 1                |
| 4           | Doe    | 2                |
+-------------+--------+------------------+
Output: 
+-------------+---------------+
| project_id  | average_years |
+-------------+---------------+
| 1           | 2.00          |
| 2           | 2.50          |
+-------------+---------------+
Explanation: The average experience years for the first project is (3 + 2 + 1) / 3 = 2.00 and for the second project is (3 + 2) / 2 = 2.50






Solution:

Intuition
We need to retrieve project_id and average experience years which are available in different tables. To accomplish this, we need to use a join two tables using JOIN operation, particularly a LEFT JOIN, as we intend to calculate the average experience of all employees involved in EACH project.

Approach
If we select project_id,employee_id, name, experience_years after using LEFT JOIN then we get

project_id	employee_id	name	experience_years
1	1	Khaled	3
1	2	Ali	2
1	3	John	1
2	1	Khaled	3
2	4	Doe	2
However, some points to consider:

we need only project_id, Average experince years ==> select only these 2 columns
For EACH project , we need to find average experience years for all employees working on that project ==> GROUP BY project_id and then find average of experience years using AVG. Make sure to round off to 2 decimals and also to retrieve this column as average_years.
Code
SELECT p.project_id, ROUND(AVG(e.experience_years),2) AS average_years
FROM Project AS p
LEFT JOIN Employee AS e
ON p.employee_id=e.employee_id
GROUP BY p.project_id;
